# EAGV3 Session 8 — Student Scaffolding

Multi-agent growing-graph orchestrator built on the Session 7 cognitive
architecture. The graph itself is the agent loop: each node is a typed
skill (Planner, Researcher, Distiller, Critic, Formatter, …), edges
carry the predecessor's `AgentResult`, and the runtime executes ready
nodes in parallel via `asyncio.gather`.

Your assignment is to ship one missing skill (the **Coder**) so the
agent can write code, run it in a subprocess sandbox, and feed the
result back through the graph. Full spec in [ASSIGNMENT.md](S8SharedCode/ASSIGNMENT.md).

## Quickstart

You need: Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Ollama
(`brew install ollama` then `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`), and at least
one provider API key from `.env.example`.

```bash
# 1. Secrets
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env                  # add the keys you have

# 2. Install
cd gateway && uv sync && cd ..
cd code    && uv sync && cd ..

# 3. Start the gateway (one terminal)
cd gateway && uv run main.py
# (or: ./run.sh)
# It boots on http://localhost:8108; /v1/routers should answer.

# 4. Run the agent (another terminal)
cd code
uv run python flow.py "hello"
```

A successful first run prints two node lines (planner, formatter) and a
greeting. Sessions land in `code/state/sessions/<sid>/`. Walk one with:

```bash
uv run python replay.py <sid>
```

---

## How to think about the architecture

The Planner reads the user query and emits a small DAG of skill nodes
to run. Each ready node fires through the gateway in parallel with its
ready siblings. When a skill's yaml entry has `internal_successors`,
the orchestrator appends those automatically — that's how **Coder →
SandboxExecutor** chains without the Planner having to ask for it.

Critic nodes get auto-inserted on edges out of skills tagged
`critic: true` in `agent_config.yaml` (currently Distiller). A
verdict=fail from a Critic splices a recovery Planner into the graph,
capped at one re-plan per branch.

Failure handling is in `recovery.py`. Transient gateway errors don't
re-plan (the gateway already retries); validation errors don't re-plan
(it's a prompt bug); upstream-failures do. `tests/test_recovery.py`
pins the classifier against the actual gateway error strings.

Read `flow.py`'s 300 lines top-to-bottom before you write a single
line of your Coder prompt. The orchestrator is small enough to fit in
your head.

## When things go wrong

| symptom | first place to look |
|---|---|
| `[gateway] launching … failed to start within 45s` | `cd gateway && uv run main.py` in another terminal; read its stderr. Probably a missing API key or port :8108 already taken. |
| `httpx.HTTPStatusError: '503 Service Unavailable'` | All worker providers in cooldown / unconfigured. Add another key to `.env` or wait a minute. |
| coder ran but `sandbox_executor` reports `no code in upstream coder output` | Your prompt isn't emitting the JSON shape the orchestrator expects. See ASSIGNMENT.md §"Output contract". |
| The final answer is short / wrong | Run `replay.py <sid>` and inspect what each node actually saw (the `prompt_sent` field captures the exact bytes sent to the gateway). |

## What NOT to touch

- `agent7_s7_carryover.py` (if present) — the Session 7 single-loop agent kept for reference. Out of scope.
- `perception.py`, `decision.py`, `action.py`, `memory.py`,
  `vector_index.py`, `artifacts.py`, `mcp_server.py` — carry over
  byte-identical from Session 7. The tool-blindness contract on
  Perception depends on these staying as-is.
- `gateway/` — treat as a service you call. If you find a real bug,
  open an issue; do not patch it inside your assignment.

---

## Provenance and version

This package is the Session 8 build that passes the round-3 review.
22 unit tests cover the failure-recovery + critic-splice mechanics.
Five validation queries (hello, S7 carryover Shannon, parallel fan-out
populations, graceful-fail nonexistent path, SIGKILL+resume) have been
verified end-to-end on the same code you have here.

If your `uv run python flow.py "hello"` produces a final answer, the
build runs cleanly on your machine. The next step is ASSIGNMENT.md.

## Assignment Submissions (Steps 4 & 5)

### Part 4: Coder Skill
The Coder skill is fully implemented in [prompts/coder.md](code/prompts/coder.md) and registered in [agent_config.yaml](code/agent_config.yaml). The orchestrator routes `coder` to `sandbox_executor` automatically as a static internal successor.
- **Verification Query**: `"Calculate the 100th Fibonacci number."`
- **Result Log**: [query_coder.md](code/result_logs/query_coder.md) (Session `s8-c44d3581`)
- **Output**: `354,224,848,179,261,915,075` (an exact calculation proving successful sandbox Python code execution).

### Part 5: New Skill (Translator)
The new `translator` skill is registered in [agent_config.yaml](code/agent_config.yaml) and the prompt defined in [prompts/translator.md](code/prompts/translator.md). The Planner and Formatter prompts were also updated to support translation tasks.
- **Verification Query**: `"Translate the paragraph 'Artificial intelligence is changing the way we develop software. Multi-agent systems can coordinate to solve complex tasks.' into French."`
- **Result Log**: [query_translator.md](code/result_logs/query_translator.md) (Session `s8-9f6e1bd6`)
- **Output**: `"L'intelligence artificielle change la façon dont nous développons des logiciels. Les systèmes multi-agents peuvent se coordonner pour résoudre des tâches complexes."`
