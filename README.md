# EAGV3 Session 8 

## Problem Statement

- Pass the five base queries (hello, A, I, J, K) from this session. Verbatim, within the iteration and wall-clock bounds named alongside each.
- Design one query that requires parallel fan-out. The query must have at least three independent sub-tasks that the Planner correctly emits as concurrent nodes. Verify that the parallel layer's wall-clock is the maximum of the branches, not the sum.
- Design one query that requires a Critic verdict. Choose a property the Critic can actually verify with the tools available to it. The Critic must produce both a pass and a fail across two runs of the query, and the fail must successfully splice in a Planner recovery that produces a corrected answer.
- Fill in the Coder skill. The current prompts/coder.md is a stub; replace it with a prompt that emits Python suitable for the SandboxExecutor. Demonstrate the Coder on one query where the answer requires computation the Formatter cannot reliably produce from text alone.
- Add one new skill to agent_config.yaml. Choose a skill that the existing catalogue does not cover. Write its prompt file. Write one query that exercises it. The orchestrator should not need modification; if it does, the modification is reportable.
